# BABS open data challenge
This site was built for the [BABS open data challenge](http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/datachallenge). The data provided was in the form of CSV files and included information from 8/29/13 to 2/28/14 about trips, stations, bike and dock availability, and weather.

The purpose of the challenge is to show some insights using the data provided so we tried to show different types of visualizations and stats using the most data as possible.

The technologies used to build the site are Rails 4 and [D3 for the visualizations](http://d3js.org/). You can find the source code in [my personal Github](https://github.com/marcferna/bikeshare). Special thanx to my colleague [Mark Bult](https://dribbble.com/markbult) for his icon designs!

Because of the Heroku free MySQL restrictions, I couldn't import all the data.
